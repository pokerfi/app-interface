Feedback from the technical community on the new "A, 2, 3, 4, 5" sets and trading contracts

Feedback from the technical community, since the logic of "A, 2, 3, 4, 5" new sets involves the replacement of the "mining contract", but currently the "mining contract" has 78% of PK assets and POKER playing cards staked by players, and cannot be transferred out (the contract is developed with the safety of user assets in consideration, so no address can be transferred out of the "mining contract" assets for no reason).
If the logic of this combination must be added, the PK assets must be migrated, and it is almost impossible for the "mining contract" to allow all current players to migrate at the same time. Even if one player refuses to migrate, it will cause the overall migration of PK assets to fail.

For the safety of players' assets and the overall stability of PokerFi, the technical community rejected the plan to carry out this update in the original contract, but in order to promote the healthy development of the player community, the technical community proposed a new solution.

By deploying a new "Activity Contract" on the official website to complete the "A, 2, 3, 4, 5" set, and to synchronize the data between the official website and PokerFi DAPP.

The new technical solution will take time to implement. The development and deployment of the new contract is expected to be completed in late August, please pay attention to the latest announcement.

Meanwhile, in order to promote the future development of PK tokens on centralized exchanges, the technical community will close the one-sided burning mechanism that deducts an additional 10% when PK tokens are sold, as resolved by the consensus committee.
