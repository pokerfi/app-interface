  Notice of resolution on two proposals initiated by technical community -- "Card slot sale restart" and "Community Ecological Stabilization Fund"

  With the healthy development of PokerFi and the continuous expansion of the scale of consensus users, PokerFi's current card slot sales volume has been unable to meet the actual needs of the current community development, especially after the official launch of PokerFi's core architecture -- "Mining pool"ï¼ŒBased on the above considerations, the technical community initiated two proposals: "Card slot sale restart" and "Ecological Stabilization Fund". The specific proposals are as follows:

  1.Card slot relaunch proposal

  In the existing card slot card association algorithm contract, when the card slot is not subscribed in the 24th round, the "card slot sale restart" will be triggered:

  (1) The number of cards issued and sold in the 25th round is: the sum of the number of unsold cards from the 1st round to the 24th round is allocated to the card sales in the next 10 days according to the existing model algorithm;

  (2) Round 26 card slot sales base will be restarted to 2000 groups, all new and old mine users can purchase on demand;

  (3) The number of cards issued in round 27-28 shall be sold normally according to the number of card slots subscribed in round 26 and the existing card slot association model algorithm;

  In order to ensure that the number of slots subscribed for round 24 reaches "0", the technical community will temporarily close the entrance of "Mine" on the home page in round 24, and the 25th and subsequent rounds will be open normally.

  2. Ecological stabilization Fund proposal

  (1) Before November 15, the community ecological Fund will support 200,000 PK to establish the "Ecological leveling Fund", which is specially used for the extraction of blind boxes not sold in a single day after the restart of card slot sale. The extraction behavior will be automatically executed through the contract, and the relevant execution address will be published;

  (2) Before November 30, the "10, J, Q, K and A" extracted by the Ecological Stabilization Fund will be set as the exchange database to support the exchange of small brands. The specific rules are as follows:
  You can exchange any card of "10, J, Q, K and A" randomly as long as you meet any one of the four combinations: 3 "2", 3 "3", 3 "4", 3 "5".

  The proposal was fully discussed by the major communities, and a resolution was made: the proposal was fully adopted, and the 24th round was opened for implementation.
  PokerFi is about to enter a period of rapid development, new stage, new starting point, new consensus, PokerFi makes everything re-imagine!
